Code structure:

- I really like the overall file structure, agent, replay_buffer,main
- However, there was a lack of comments and there were many commented lines of code
- Furthermore there were functions that were never called

Functionality:

- My console got spammed with "Optimization loop failed: CANCELLED: Operation was cancelled"
- You furthermore decrease epsilon every epoch and do not reset it to its initial value
- And also introducing a lower bound on epsilon could hinder the theoretical convergence
